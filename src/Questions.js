            "A disease",
            "A genetic anomaly"
        ],
        solutionIndex: 1,
        explanation: "These are people who have genetic abnormalities, and in the case of Down syndrome at birth. So it’s not something you can develop in your lifetime. Even less something you can choose!"

        ],
        solutionIndex: 1,
        explanation: "The previously short life expectancy of people with Down syndrome was due to the different heart diseases common in these people. Today treatments have developed and life expectancy has increased to over 60 years"

        ],
        solutionIndex: 0,
        explanation: "With a rate of 1 in 700 births, trisomy 21 is the first genetic abnormality in the world ahead of sickle cell disease (1/ 1900) and cystic fibrosis (1/4000)."

        question: "Down Syndrome is also called Trisomy 21. Where does this name come from?",
        answers: [
            "Symptoms are caused by an anomaly on the 21st pair of chromosomes",
            "It was first observed in 1921",
            "It is the 21st recognized genetic condition",
            "There were initially 21 people showing symptoms of Down Syndrom"

            "False"
        ],

        question: "Among this list of characteristics, which one is a risk factor for Down Syndrome?",
        answers: [
            "Poor fetal nutrition",
            "Too much sport during the pregnancy",
            "Smoking exposition during the first months after birth",
            "Parents' risky behaviors before birth: drinking, smoking...",
        ],
        solutionIndex: 3,
        explanation: "Risk behaviours increase the chances of genetic mutations hence of Down syndrome. However, diet or sport does not reach the foetus during pregnancy. Smoking after birth is certainly very harmful for a child but cannot be linked to Down syndrome. In addition, scientists have discovered genetic transmission of Down syndrome between affected parents and their children."

        question: "Who is the first to have clinically described Down syndrome?",

        ],
        solutionIndex: 2,
        explanation: "In 1838, John Langdon Haydon Down published an official clinical description of Down syndrome. His description of great accuracy later led the scientific community to name it after him"

        question: "People who have Down Syndrome are always happy. True or False?",
        answers: [
            "True",
            "False",
        ],
        solutionIndex: 1,

        ],
        solutionIndex: 1,
        explanation: "It is obviously false! There may be a few differences between you two, but this is not something to be afraid of. A lot of people who have Down Syndrome are friends with, live, date and marry people who don't necessarily have this Syndrome."
