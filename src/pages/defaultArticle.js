    title: 'What is Down Syndrome International?',
    content: "Of all the genetic anomalies that exist, if trisomy 21 is one of the best known, it is not by chance. Already in 1866, Doctor John Langdon-Down described with great accuracy the different syndromes linked to Down syndrome (it is from this doctor that the genetic anomaly got its name). These first discoveries will allow the scientific community, in 1959, to present the conclusions of a genetic anomaly responsible for trisomy 21. It is the first time in the history of medicine and science that a chromosomal anomaly is described and recognized in humans. The news will thus benefit from a great international repercussion which will make it possible thereafter to introduce the trisomics to the eyes of the general public.It is in this context that Down Syndrome International was founded in 1993 by Jo Mills (Canada), Penny Robertson (Australia) and Sylvia Escamilla (Mexico). The goal of the organization is simple: to raise public awareness of the condition of people with genetic defects and to improve their living conditions by participating in the development of certain key sectors. They are particularly involved in training schools so that they can offer adapted courses to students with Down syndrome. One of their most important points is the formation and support of groups and associations related to Down syndrome around the world, giving them a voice.Down Syndrome International made its name in 2006 by lobbying for the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at the United Nations. The purpose of this convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. In 2011, after an extensive campaign to gather international support, the Brazilian Federation of Associations of Down Syndrome and Down Syndrome International tabled a resolution at the United Nations defining March 21 as the official day of people with Down Syndrome. This victory will propel Down Syndrome International as a leading global organization specializing in the issue of Down syndrome.The international credibility of Down Syndrome International will allow it to rapidly develop its activity in the world. The following year, the first WDSD (World Down Syndrome Day) conference was held at the United Nations, which will be repeated every year, and which will allow the world to become aware of the issues of people with Down syndrome. This was followed by visits and concrete actions around the world to support projects related to Down Syndrome.Today Down Syndrome International develops its activity on the web with several concrete actions aiming at developing the image of disabled people on the internet. For example in May 2022 Kani, the first virtual influencer with Down syndrome, is born. Her mission is to revolutionize the internet to make it an inclusive and welcoming place for people with Down syndrome.",
